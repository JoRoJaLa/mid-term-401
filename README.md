Tool Share is an app sharing platform where users can find and share tools within their city.



MVP (for systemrequirements.md)
- User can create account
- Search for a certain tool and match them with
another user that has that tool (by closest location?)
- tools the user has loaned saved to their account,
  deposit for tool is added
- Match on city, only in US
- Preset Tools
- What tools are out there? Only can find tools within the city.
- How are these people going to meet each other?
- Don't show a map
- Dead simple address to meet
- Have to remove tools from the search if they are checked out.
- State that anyone has access to user information.
