## Description
Tool Share is an app sharing platform where users can find and share tools within their city.
### User Stories
- As a tool owner, I want the ability to advertise spare tools, so that other people can borrow them.
- As a person in need of a tool, I want the ability to search for a tool, and be provided the closest tool lender within my location search vicinity, so that I can complete the project I am working on and not need to buy another tool from the store.
- As a person with limited space within my apartment, I want to be able to borrow tools from people in my area, so that I dont have find a place to store them once my need of them is finished.
- As a person interested in sustainability, I want to alleviate stress on the consumer chain by borrowing rather than purchasing new tools that will inevitably be used very little.
- As a person interested in providing oppurtunities for connection, I want to build community by sharing resources, so that new relatationships can be established and stronger communities are built.
### Minimal Viable Product
